# RailTransBot
The Telegram gamebot for the group chat about trains

Supply the city with appropriate goods, buy new trains and build the greatest railway empire!

At the beginning you have 4 trains. Market displays what city needs are. Send your trains to supply city with appropriate goods

If city is oversupplied with appropriate good, then the cost of one train, which supplies this good, falls down

The goal is to send trains on supply smarly to get most income

The project is implemented for an appropriate chat - https://t.me/nause121 . To make it avaiable for all chats, I should have more powerful server, which means more spends, so it is available only for chat NOW
