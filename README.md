# RailTransBot
The Telegram gamebot for the group chat about trains. My bachelor diploma project

Supply the city with appropriate goods, buy new trains and build the greatest railway empire!

At the beginning you have 4 trains. Market displays what city needs are. Send your trains to supply city with appropriate goods

If city is oversupplied with appropriate good, then the cost of one train, which supplies this good, falls down

The goal is to send trains on supply smartly to get most income
